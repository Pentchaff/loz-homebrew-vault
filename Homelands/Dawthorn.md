## About Dawthorn

Amidst tall, jagged rock formations, Dawthorn is a mysterious and fog-covered woodland. The Echidnarians' homes are built into tree trunks and rock crevices. Suspended bridges connect treetop platforms, and the forest floor is a patchwork of herbs and ferns. The sound of wind chimes is ever-present, creating a melody with the forest's natural whispers.
