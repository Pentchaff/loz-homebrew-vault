#### Marsh-Woven Satchel of Holding
- **Description:** Crafted from durable marsh reeds and enchanted by local spellcasters, this bag has extra-dimensional pockets that can hold far more than its size suggests.
- **Mechanic:** Acts like a Bag of Holding but with half the carrying capacity. It has the added benefit of floating on water.
- **Price:** 400 gold pieces
