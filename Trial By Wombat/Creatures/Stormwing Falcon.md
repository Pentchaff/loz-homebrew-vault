For the Kookari, spotting a Stormwing Falcon is a sign of Runnal, the Sky Spirit's blessingâ€”a good omen, indeed. Tales say that these birds often circle above sacred rituals, their presence amplifying the spiritual energy of the congregation below. Their feathers are considered sacred and are often used in ceremonial garbs and as foci for wind-based spells.

**Windcaller**: Once per short or long rest, the Stormwing Falcon can summon a 10-foot-radius gust of wind around itself, strong enough to extinguish unprotected flames and impose disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks that pass through it. The gust lasts until the start of the falcon's next turn.
