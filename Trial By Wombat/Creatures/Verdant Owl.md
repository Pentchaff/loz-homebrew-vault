The [[Koalari]] often claim that the Verdant Owls are the link between the tree spirits and the winds, relaying messages and omens from one to the other. Among shamans, to see a Verdant Owl is considered a sign that [[Eucalys, the Tree Spirit]] and [[Runnal, the Sky Spirit]] are watching over you, often an omen of good things to come.
