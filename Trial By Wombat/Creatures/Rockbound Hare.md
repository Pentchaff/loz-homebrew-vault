The [[Wallabian]] believe encountering a Rockbound Hare while traversing the landscapes of [[Valleybrook]] is a sign of [[Bunyara, the Land Spirit]]'s favor. Some even carry small talismans made of similar stone-like material as the hares, believing these relics enhance their connection with the land spirit and bring them luck.
