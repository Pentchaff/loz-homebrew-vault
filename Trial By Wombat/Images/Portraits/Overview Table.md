**Notes on Enclaves**:

1. **Sunbridge (Sydney)**: A bustling hub where [[Quokkan]], [[Wallabian]], [[Petaurii]], and [[Kookari]] coexist, with iconic bridges and harbors. They thrive in trade but face threats from the [[Crocosian]] who wish to expand their territory.
    
2. **Rivergate (Brisbane)**: Located at a confluence of rivers, this is a peaceful enclave of [[Platypian]] and [[Koalari]]. However, the [[Pipistrellian]], who were driven underground, now plot beneath the city streets.
    
3. **Hollowpeak (Perth)**: A coastal city built around massive eucalyptus trees and is home to [[Koalari]] and [[Wallabian]] communities. It's also one of the last places where legends of the extinct Thylacirian and [[Diprotean]] are still actively spoken about.
    
4. **Twilight Forest (Canberra)**: A wooded enclave where [[Quokkan]] and [[Echidnarian]] councils meet, deciding the fate of Oziria.
    

In terms of dynamics, the [[Canidor]] and [[Crocosian]] often try to expand their territories, leading to potential conflicts. The extinction of Thylacirian and [[Diprotean]] are shrouded in mystery, with rumors that [[Pipistrellian]] or human intervention may have played a role. The [[Echidnarian]], being methodical, often stay out of major conflicts, but their strategic knowledge is sought after.

| **[[Quokkan]]**        | Native to the island of [[Rotrest]], the [[Quokkan]]s are the jovial diplomats of Oziria.

| **[[Platypian]]**      | As guardians of the Rivermeld, they've repelled [[Pipistrellian]] attempts to dominate the waterways.                                                                                                      | They prize knowledge and hope to create a vast archive of Oziria's history, emphasizing coexistence.                  |
| **Tasmnanianites** | From the isolated isles of Tasmire, their territorial nature led to disputes with [[Wallabian]]s.                                                                                                          | They seek recognition and respect for their lands and aim to solidify their borders while also opening trade routes.  |
| **[[Wombari]]**        | Settled in Burrowtown's mountainous terrain, they've been historically ambushed by [[Canidor]] packs.                                                                                                      | They prioritize community safety and are working on advanced defense mechanisms for their homes.                      |
| **[[Echidnarian]]**    | The wanderers of Spinehold desert, their self-sufficiency has spared them from most conflicts, though they've occasionally aided [[Thornar]] against external threats.                                     | With a deep respect for the land, their goal is to prevent desertification and maintain the balance of Oziria.        |
| **[[Crocosian]]**      | The swamp lords of Sunswamp, they've frequently tried expanding, clashing primarily with [[Quokkan]]s and [[Platypian]]s.                                                                                      | Desiring dominance, they intend to expand their territory but also recognize the value of strategic alliances.        |
| **[[Koalari]]**        | Eucalytopolis residents have always been sages.

| **[[Petaurii]]**       | Inhabiting the treetops of [[Nightleaf]], their adventurous nature led to minor feuds with [[Canidor]]s over territory.                                                                                        | Prioritizing exploration, they hope to map the entirety of Oziria and find new lands.                                 |
| **[[Kookari]]**        | Coastal dwellers of [[Laughing Peak]], their creative endeavors have occasionally been disrupted by [[Crocosian]] raids.                                                                                       | Holding creativity sacred, they dream of building a grand theater showcasing Oziria's tales.                          |

| **[[Canidor]]**        | Originating from [[Reddune]], their predatory nature has led them into conflicts with several races, primarily [[Kangaroon]]s and [[Wombari]]s.                                                                    | Driven by survival, they aim to expand their hunting grounds, but also seek a stable food source to reduce conflicts. |
| **Thylacirian**    | Once ruling [[Echohaven]], they faded into extinction due to combined external pressures, with legends blaming [[Canidor]]s.                                                                                   | While now extinct, ancient texts suggest their primary goal was peaceful coexistence.                                 |
| **[[Diprotean]]**      | [[Grasstide]]'s gentle giants were revered by many, but their slow nature made them vulnerable to changes in the environment and external threats.                                                         | Their ancient scrolls emphasize harmony with nature and a desire to nurture the land.                                 |
