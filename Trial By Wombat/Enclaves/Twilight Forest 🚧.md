Deep within a dense, mystic forest lies Twilight Forest. Enshrouded in perpetual dusk, this enclave serves as the neutral ground for the major races of Oziria. At its heart stands the Great Council Tree, where Quokkan diplomats and Echidnarian strategists meet under its vast canopy. Time seems to stand still here, as momentous decisions that shape the realm's fate are deliberated upon. The Echidnarians, with their methodical nature, document every treaty, while the Quokkans bring their innate ability to mediate and foster peace. Every decision made here sends ripples across Oziria, binding races in unity or pushing them apart.
