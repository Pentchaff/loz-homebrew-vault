#### Azure Depths (Great Barrier Reef): Sacred Underwater City

Once a vibrant underwater city controlled by the Crocosians, the Azure Depths stands testament to nature's majesty. Legends say that a pact between the Koalari druids and the Crocosians preserved the delicate corals. However, as tensions rose, a cataclysmic battle decimated much of its beauty, leaving behind submerged ruins waiting to be rediscovered.
