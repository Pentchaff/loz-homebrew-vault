#### Twin-Spire Keep (Twelve Apostles): Castle

Erected by the Wallabian, this coastal fortress was designed to keep watch over the ocean's threats. Its two primary towers stand tall against time, though the others have crumbled, taken by the sea. Legends say that the keep hides Wallabian treasures.
