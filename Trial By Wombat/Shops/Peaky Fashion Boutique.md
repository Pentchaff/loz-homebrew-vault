# Peaky Fashion Boutique

Perched at the crossroads of style and comfort, the Peaky Fashion Boutique is a feast for the eyes. A Kookari named Featherstitch manages the store, and she's a connoisseur of all things fashionable yet practical. Patrons walk on soft rugs made of woven mountain grass as they shop through a myriad of mountain chic apparel. Aromatic incense of mountain herbs wafts through the air, tickling the senses and delighting the spirit.
