# Elevated Emporium

As soon as you step into the Elevated Emporium, the scent of oiled leather and cool metal fills the air. The walls are adorned with every imaginable tool for the mountaineer: ropes, hooks, crampons, and all manner of adventuring gear. But this is no ordinary mountain supply store; each item is imbued with a touch of Laughing Peak magic, making your climb not just easier but also more joyful.
