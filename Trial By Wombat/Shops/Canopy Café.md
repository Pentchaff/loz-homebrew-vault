# Canopy Café

Situated in a clearing surrounded by towering trees, the Canopy Café is run by Sylverleaf, an Echidnarian chef of extraordinary talent. This open-air eatery welcomes you with the intoxicating aroma of freshly baked pies and simmering potions. Wooden tables and chairs, carved from fallen trees and wrapped in vines, dot the clearing, inviting diners to sit and savor. As you dine, you feel the embrace of Dawthorn itself, a feeling made tangible through the enchanting flavors offered.
