# Luminous Lures Tackle Shop

Tucked away near the babbling brooks of Dawthorn, Luminous Lures Tackle Shop is a charming establishment run by Brooksong, an Echidnarian angler with a sixth sense for fishing in enchanted waters. Inside the wooden hut, fishing rods and reels are neatly arranged, and jars filled with bioluminescent bait catch your eye. The atmosphere is imbued with the promise of a magical catch.
