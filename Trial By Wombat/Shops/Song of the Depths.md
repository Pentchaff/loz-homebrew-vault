### Song of the Depths - The Whispering Marshes

Music is an integral part of the culture of the people living in the Whispering Marshes. Song of the Depths is dedicated to the unique aquatic instruments that evoke the melodies of the marsh. The shop is run by a talented musician who often entertains visitors with impromptu performances on the lagoon flute or the waterstrung harp.
