# Highrise Café

As you ascend the stone stairway to Highrise Café, the altitude almost seems to melt away, replaced by the inviting scents of freshly baked goods and brewed coffee. The café is a cozy nook run by Baristacaw, a jovial Kookari who's as quick with a joke as he is with a steam wand. The open-air terrace gives patrons a breathtaking panorama of the Laughing Peak landscape. And, oh, the specialty items—each one holds the magic of the mountain in edible form.
