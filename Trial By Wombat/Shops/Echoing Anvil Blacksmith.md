# Echoing Anvil Blacksmith

Deep within the labyrinthine foliage of Dawthorn, the Echoing Anvil Blacksmith stands as a symbol of Echidnarian craftsmanship. Run by the master blacksmith Barkthorn, this humble but enchanted forge is warmed by a green flame that never goes out. Vines entangle the wooden structure, and the soft sound of forest whispers accompanies each hammer strike. Here, weapons and armor are not just forgedâ€”they are born from the very essence of the forest itself.
