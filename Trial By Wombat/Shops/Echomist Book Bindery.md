# Echomist Book Bindery

Tucked away between towering, moss-draped trees, the Echomist Book Bindery looks like a woodland temple dedicated to the gods of lore and wisdom. Managed by the venerable Sagebark, an Echidnarian elder, the store is filled with the aroma of aged paper and binding glue. As you step in, your eyes are greeted by shelves upon shelves of tomes, journals, and scrollsâ€”all bathed in the soft glow of lanterns filled with firefly light.
