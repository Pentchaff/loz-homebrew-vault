# Songbird Instruments

Located deep within the forest, near a grove where birds of all kinds congregate, Songbird Instruments is the brainchild of Harmonia, an Echidnarian artisan with a keen ear for nature's music. When you enter, you can almost hear the forest singing through the instruments on display. Wall-mounted flutes, drum sets hewn from logs, and delicate harps all await their next virtuoso in this enchanted shop.
