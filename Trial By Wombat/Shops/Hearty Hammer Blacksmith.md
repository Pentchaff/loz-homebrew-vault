Managed by Ironchuckle, a master blacksmith with a sense of humor as strong as his arm, the Hearty Hammer Blacksmith is the epitome of Kookari craftsmanship. Step inside, and you'll find armor adorned with plumes that shake like a belly full of laughter and swords that ring with jubilance as they slice through the air.
