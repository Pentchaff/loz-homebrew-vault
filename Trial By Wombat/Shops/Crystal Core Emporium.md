### Crystal Core Emporium - Earthshaper Caverns
Located in Earthshaper Caverns, the Crystal Core Emporium appears to be a radiant chamber filled with prismatic light. Shelves and tables are adorned with various sizes and shapes of crystals, their colors glistening with an inner fire. Managed by a Wombari sage named Gemwhisker, the store exudes a calm atmosphere, allowing customers to feel at peace as they navigate through rows of earthly treasures.
