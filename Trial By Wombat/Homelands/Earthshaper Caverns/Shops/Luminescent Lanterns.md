### Luminescent Lanterns - Earthshaper Caverns

Focusing on the natural darkness of caverns, Luminescent Lanterns offers lighting solutions made with bio-luminescent fungi and enchanted gems. Specialties include glow-in-the-dark lanterns, pathway markers, and decorative lamps. The bio-luminescent fungi are harvested with care to ensure their luminescence lasts as long as possible, and the enchanted gems are sourced from the deepest parts of the caverns.
