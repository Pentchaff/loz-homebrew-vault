## About Earthshaper Caverns

Carved into the heart of the majestic Amethyst Range, the Earthshaper Caverns are a wonder. Stalactites and stalagmites form natural architecture, and the Wombari enhance these with intricate carvings. Glowing minerals light up the cave interiors, and underground springs provide freshwater. 

Craftsmanship is at its peak here, with gem-encrusted artworks and sculptures. The Wombari are expert miners, and are at constant pace when digging new tunnels in search of gems and rare metals to infuse into their crafts, earning them merit as the main manufacturers and distributors of many tools, weapons and armour that spreads to the ends of Oziria.

Homes are carved chambers within the cavern walls, adorned with gem embellishments and mineral mosaics. Each dwelling is lit by luminescent stones.
