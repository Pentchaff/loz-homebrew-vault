#### Approaching the Rallying Point

>[!recite|bg-gray] Narrator
>_"As you leave the confines of Everbreeze and journey into the dense wilderness, the echoing sounds of Everbreeze's marketplace give way to the distant sounds of chanting and war drums. Through the trees, you catch glimpses of a clearing ahead. Drawn to the noise and energy, you cautiously approach."_

>[!recite|bg-c-red] If the players choose violence at any point
>This is a stealth/dialogue rewarding chapter. Should the players opt for violence at any part, proceed to [[TTR-2-Assault Outcome]]**


Provided to players passively:

>[!recite|bg-blue] ***Passive perception (10):***
*"You notice that the congregation of Todek is vast in number. Although the Todek are a relatively weak and cowardly race, a grouping of this size, tied in with their toxic-surfaced skin may prove deadly if they were to muster the courage to attack you."*

If the party wish to actively investigate:

>[!recite|bg-green] ***Perception/Investigation check (DC 14):***
>- **Success**: *"You notice a pattern amongst the scouts patrolling the area. Some Todek remain vigilant, while other are either loafing around or never bringing their sight in your direction. With patience and well timed movements you should be able to approach the rally point via a large tree, concealing the party in the process"*
>- **Failure**: *"There's so much chaos amidst this congregation you're finding it difficult to plan out a solid approach to the rally point. There doesn't appear to be any suitable cover to shroud yourself."*

If the party opt into stealth to get near the rally point:

>[!recite|bg-orange] Stealth Check (DC 10)
> Players must roll stealth or risk being spotted by the patrolling Todek
> 
>**SUCCESS**: The players can safely listen in to the speech and gather some intel. **Proceed to [[#Witnessing [[Vorkesh]]'s Speech]]**
>**FAILURE**: Suspicion is aroused at the parties location and a Todek approaches to investigate. Roll a **d4** to determine who approaches:
>
>- **(1)** ---  **Read to players and navigate to the [[TTR-2-Alarm Outcome]]**
>  *"A scouting Todek approaches your location with haste. Before you have a chance to react your position is compromised and the Todek bellows out an alarming croak. As the warning signal carries throughout the camp, you hear responses from the other Todek echo the call as if some hive mind alert snaps the rest of the camp into action."*
>  
>- **(2)** --- **Navigate to the [[TTR-2-Intimidation Outcome]]**
>  
>- **(3)** --- **Read to players and navigate to the [[TTR-2-Dissenting Ally Outcome]]**
>  *'You head the dragging footsteps of a scout close in on your location. Accompanying the sound are subtle croaks and moans of discontent'* 
>  
>  - **(4) --- Read to players and continue to [[#Witnessing [[Vorkesh]]'s Speech]] below**
>    *"You spot a scout stop in their tracks and look toward your location. They let out a confused groak and a slimey gulp. As they squint in your direction, you can't tell if they are all too keen to approach, or possibly care enough to investigate. Before long, another Todek on patrol continues their path with little awareness and walks straight into the alerted scout, causing him to jump before bellowing an grunty croak at the other. They compose themselves and carry in with their duties"*

#### Witnessing [[Vorkesh]]'s Speech

_"The clearing opens up to reveal a massive gathering of Todek, their numbers far greater than any would expect for such a typically dispersed race. At the center, atop a raised platform constructed of timber and bone, stands a striking Todek. His scales shimmer with an unusual vibrancy, and he speaks with a fervor that captivates his audience. As his deep voice booms across the clearing, even from your hidden vantage point, you can't help but feel the gravity of his words. This, unmistakably, is [[Vorkesh]]. His promises of power, territory, and a unified Todek future echo with conviction, met with roars of approval from the assembled masses."_

>[!recite|bg-gray] Before hearing the intel
>Give the players the opportunity to observe the war room and entice them with some additionally risky recon for full details and some loot.
>***Perception/Investigation check (DC 16)***
>- **Success:*** "Near the centre of the rally point, a rather large and well maintained tent is pitched. For fleeting moments, the gusts in the area blow open the tent door and it becomes obvious that this is some sort of war room. "*
>- **Failure:** *"The scrappy makeshift tents propped up around the rally point look crude and unusable by your standards"*
>  
>  If the players opt into recon in War Room, **proceed to [[TTR-2-Infiltration Outcome]]**
>
>Otherwise, **proceed to [[#Relgar's Plan]] below**.

#### Relgar's Plan
The party manage to listen into the entire speech, and gather enough intel to understand where the Todek are planning to attack.

>[!recite|bg-gray] Narrator
>"As [[Vorkesh]] continues his speech, you spot another Todek just off to his side, observing the crowd with sharp, calculating eyes. Unlike [[Vorkesh]]'s passionate demeanor, this Todek seems cold, analytical. Overhearing whispers from a pair of Todek guards nearby, you catch the name 'Relgar.' The conversation is hushed, but the reverence in their tone is unmistakable. Rumors suggest that while [[Vorkesh]] might be the heart of this movement, Relgar is its strategic mind, orchestrating their rapid and unexpected expansions."_

> [!recite|bg-yellow] ***Relgar***: 
> *"My brethren, the plan is already in motion. As we speak, the waters of Mirebrook run black. If [[Platypian]] cannot withstand our toxins it will only be a matter of time before the weaker fall with them. We can and shall lay claim to lands we've been held from for so long. Let today mark the day that we rise up. All that is shiny... WILL. BE. OURS!"*
