>A scouting Todek slowly approaches your hiding spot. Their armor is a patchwork of scavenged materials, indicating a lower rank. Aware to the noises you've made, he drags his feet toward you, kicking the ground with his heel. He seems clearly disgruntled, acting like the noises you have created are more of an inconvenience than anything.

>You see him scratch his back with his spear as he waddles closer before composing himself and turning the corner.

>[!recite|bg-blue] ###### Optional Insight check
> If any of the players are quite perceptive/insightful, or if they ask questions about Scorg, ask them to roll an insight check.

> >You feel that Scorg doesn't want to be here. Judging by his mumbling and tumbling demeanour, you get the sense that he's not too happy about the new leader.  If you're nice enough he might just let you go... Or perhaps his disdain might work in your favour?

From here, the players can either persuade, intimidate or attack Scorg:
