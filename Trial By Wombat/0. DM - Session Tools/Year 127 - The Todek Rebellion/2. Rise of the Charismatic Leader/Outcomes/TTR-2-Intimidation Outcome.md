### DM Narration:

>[!recite|bg-gray] Narrator
>A scouting Todek slowly approaches your hiding spot. Their armor is a patchwork of scavenged materials, indicating a lower rank. Sensing your approach, they tighten the grip on their spear but hesitates, as if calculating the odds of survival should he engage you. His name tag stitched haphazardly onto his armor reads "[[Squig]]."
>
>You see them shiver in anxiety as they get closer. There's fear in his eyes, as if there are unspoken horrors awaiting them should they see out their duties. they peek behind the cover and and tremble at your sight. Unable to speak, their eyes beg you to spare them.

>[!recite|bg-blue] ###### Optional Insight check
> If any of the players are quite perceptive/insightful, or if they ask questions about [[Squig]], ask them to roll an insight check.
> >[!recite|bg-green] Success
> >You sense that [[Squig]] is telling the truth but withholding some details. He knows more than he's letting on.
> 
> >[!recite|bg-red] Failure
> > [[Squig]]'s jittery demeanor makes it hard to read him. You're unsure if he's telling the whole truth.


From here, the players can either persuade, intimidate or attack [[Squig]]:

>[!recite|bg-grey] ###### Intimidation [[Squig]] (DC10)
>==*The party can threaten [[Squig]]. He will give in easily and provide the party with any information if they let him go.*==
>
>>[!recite|bg-green] **Success:** 
>>[[Squig]] trembles, his spear nearly slipping from his grasp. 
>>>[!quote] [[Squig]]
>>>"Fine, fine! Donâ€™t hurt me. We're planning to poison the water in [[Mirebrook]]! Just don't kill me, okay?"
>>
>>**Proceed to the [[TTR-2-Complete Intel Outcome]]**
>
>>[!recite|bg-red] **Failure:** 
>>Despite the fear in his eyes, your intimidation tactics land shy of completely comical. He calms down, and remembers he has a duty to fulfil. [[Squig]] bolts back to the scouting path, letting out a weak, yet alarming croak to the rest of the encampment.
>>>[!quote] [[Squig]]
>>>You're no threat! Our fearless leader will protect me!
>>
>>**Proceed to the [[TTR-2-Alarm Outcome]]**

>[!recite|bg-grey c-black] ###### Persuade [[Squig]] (DC14)
>
>*The party can persuade [[Squig]] to give them information, but if he gets the sense that the party is not as hostile as he thought, he may muster the courage to call the guards.*
>>[!recite|bg-green] Success
>>[[Squig]]'s trembling lower in intesity, as he considers your words non-threatening. He cares for the Todek, but perhaps what's happening isn't the answer to their problems. [[Squig]] imparts some knowledge about their plans to taint the [[Platypian]] waters with toxins so strong even their resistance to such ailments would not overcome.
>>>[!quote] [[Squig]]
>>>"Head to [[Mirebrook]] and you will see first hand what the toxin is capable of. Be quick or things could end really bad!"
>>
>>**Proceed to the [[TTR-2-Complete Intel Outcome]]**
>
>>[!recite|bg-red] Failure
>>You try to reason with [[Squig]], perhaps a little too kindly. He notices you are not nearly as threatening as you seem. He calms down, and remembers he has a duty to fulfil. [[Squig]] bolts back to the scouting path, letting out a weak, yet alarming croak to the rest of the encampment.
>>>[!quote] [[Squig]] 
>>>You're no threat! Our new leader will protect me!

>>**Proceed to the [[TTR-2-Alarm Outcome]]**
