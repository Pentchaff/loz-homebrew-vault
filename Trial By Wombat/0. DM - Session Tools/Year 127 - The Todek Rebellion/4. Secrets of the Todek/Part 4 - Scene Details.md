**The Prophecy's Disclosure**

>[!recite|bg-gray] To the players
>As you enter the familiar gates of [[Everbreeze]], the gentle wind carrying the fragrant notes of blooming flora greets you. It's a stark contrast to the poisoned lands you've just returned from. In the bustling market square, a hooded figure approaches, recognizing your party amidst the crowd. With a cautious glance around, they pass you a scroll sealed with the symbol of a serpent coiled around a crescent moon.

Unraveling the scroll, it reads:

> _'In the shadow of time's forgotten past,_  
> _When turmoil rises and skies overcast,_  
> _A leader shall emerge from the Todek's vast,_  
> _Uniting the tribes, a spell to recast._  
> _The lands will tremble, in fear or in awe,_  
> _For the Todek's dominion shall be the new law.'_

The weight of the prophecy hangs heavy in the air. The Todek's recent aggressions now seem to be part of a larger plan, tied to an age-old ambition."

**2. The Temple's Revelation**

>[!recite|bg-gray] To the players
>After sharing the prophecy with your trusted contacts in Everbreeze, a learned sage named Eldrin beckons you to his study. The walls are lined with ancient texts, scrolls, and maps that seem to hold secrets of centuries gone by.

>[!recite|bg-yellow] With a deep sigh, Eldrin speaks, 
>>[!quote] Eldrin
>>'The Todek have long been fragmented, their aggression spread thin across different factions. But this [[Vorkesh]]... he seems to be the linchpin to their newfound unity. However, hope is not lost. I've heard tales of a temple, hidden deep within the Withering Woods, obscured by magic and time.'

>[!recite|bg-gray] To the players
>He unrolls a map, pointing to an unmarked section. 'It's said this temple holds the Elixir of Aether, a potion with the power to purify any poison or breach any barrier. If [[Vorkesh]]'s strength is rooted in the Todek's poison and his shield, then this might just be the key to breaking his grasp.'
>
>The map rustles under the soft glow of the candlelight, and a new quest beckons. The temple, with its potential salvation for the land, awaits your exploration."
