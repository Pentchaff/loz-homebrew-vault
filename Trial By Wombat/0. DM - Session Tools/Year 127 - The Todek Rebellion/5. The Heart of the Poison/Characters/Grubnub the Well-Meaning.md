**Appearance:** Grubnub is of average [[Todek]] size but has an oddly charming, wonky set of front teeth that protrude slightly when he talks. His scales are mottled, a mishmash of browns and greens, and his eyes are large and perpetually wide, always looking a little startled.

**Personality:** Grubnub is earnest and well-meaning, albeit easily distracted and not the brightest bulb in the box. He tries to come off as diplomatic and knowledgeable but often uses words incorrectly or misunderstands complex concepts. Still, his heart is in the right place, and he genuinely wants what's best for the Todek.

**Quirks:**

- Carries around a "diplomat stick," which is essentially a branch he found. He thinks it gives him authority.
- Has a habit of nodding enthusiastically even if he doesnâ€™t understand something.
- Will often mix up big words, trying to sound more impressive: "This is an unprecedented predication!" instead of "This is an unprecedented situation!"
