The smoke of battle begins to thin, replaced by an expectant silence that blankets the field. From the remnants of the Todek horde, a solitary figure hesitantly emerges. This Todek looks different from the others; his scales are a mishmash of browns and greens, and a pair of wonky front teeth jut out slightly when he moves his lips. He clutches a stick, which he holds aloft as if it were some staff of state.

As he approaches, you can see his large eyes darting around, full of both nervousness and a curious hope. "Hello, big not-Todek friends! I am Grubnub, the big... diplomatist of Todek. We talk, yes? No bites."

He pauses, seeming to gather his thoughts (and probably all the big words he knows). "Todek make mistakes. Bad things happened. Grubnub want make better. Peace... that's word, right? We want peace. And place. Place for Todek. Grubnub can show Todek to be good, to have... what word? Home! Yes, home. Grubnub can be good leader. Need land. Need chance."

He looks earnestly at each of you, his eyes wide and hopeful, a simpleton thrust into the role of a diplomat, doing his best to secure a future for his people.
