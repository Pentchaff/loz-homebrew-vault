#### Elder Billee’s Path

>[!recite|bg-gray] **DM** 
>Elder Billee tells you she needs a rare herb to complete her cleansing ritual. The herb is further in town but is guarded by Gorak The Brute.

#### Objective
The Party need to stealth their way around Gorak the Brute (or take him on in combat) in order to harvest the herb required to complete the ritual

##### Approaching Gorak
>[!recite|bg-gray] DM
>As you stealthily traverse the narrow pathways leading to the center of the village, your senses are suddenly inundated by a grating sound echoing through the empty streets. "FIFTY-FOUR! FIFTY-FIVE! FIFTY-SIX!" The counting grows louder, and as you turn the corner, the source of the booming voice comes into view.
>
>There, standing like an unmovable boulder, is Gorak the Brute. This Todek is unlike any you’ve encountered before; his scales resemble jagged stones, toughened by battles and unyielding time. His bulging muscles ripple with every push-up he completes, shaking the very ground beneath him. Unlike his kin, who rely on armor for protection, Gorak stands arrogantly exposed, confident that his scales and brawn are armor enough.
>
>The air around him is thick with tension, and his eyes, small and beady, are like hot coals that could ignite into a raging fire at any moment. He halts his push-ups and rises to his full, intimidating height, cracking the bones in his neck with a quick jerk of his head.

#### Returning the Herbs
>[!recite|bg-gray] DM
>"You step into Elder Billee's sanctuary, a small chamber suffused with the sweet aroma of burning sage and the soft glow of enchanted candles. The Elder herself stands at a carved wooden altar, an array of totems, and mystical objects laid out before her. She looks up as you enter, her eyes twinkling like distant stars."
