_Todek Spotter - Cautious Scout_

This lower-ranking Todek is always on alert, wary of his surroundings and potential threats. He's loyal to [[Vorkesh]]'s cause and quick to raise the alarm if he detects anything amiss. Despite his loyalty, he's inexperienced in the grand scheme of things and can be prone to moments of panic or indecision.

- **Quirk**: Constantly checks his surroundings, even when seemingly safe. His head swivels or he frequently glances over his shoulder as if expecting something or someone.
