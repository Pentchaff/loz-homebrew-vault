**INTRO**

_"As the sun rises, casting a golden glow over the serene town of [[Everbreeze]], nestled amidst the whispering trees and gentle hills, you find yourselves amidst the daily bustle of the townsfolk. The air is fresh, with just a hint of morning mist. However, a palpable tension hangs in the atmosphere, a stark contrast to the town's tranquil name."_

**Players hear rumors of small skirmishes along the border towns.**

_"You're jostled by the morning crowd as you make your way through Everbreeze. Everywhere you turn, townsfolk are huddled in hushed conversations. As you pass by, snippets of whispered concerns reach your ears - tales of surprise skirmishes along the border towns. The common sentiment is one of confusion and surprise; the attackers are said to be [[Todek]], a race not typically known for organized aggression."_

**Initial investigations reveal symbols and banners representing a new Todek faction.**

_"Following the hushed whispers and the pointed fingers of wary townsfolk, you find yourself at a local bulletin board. Plastered across it are various sketches and reports, but one, in particular, catches your eye: a drawn banner, a symbol unfamiliar to you. Asking around, you come to understand that this represents a new faction of the Todek, one that seems far more coordinated than any before."_

**Injured [[Wallabian]] is brought back into town, seemingly poisoned and currently unconscious (Name: [[Bindi]]).**

*"As you're piecing together the rumors and reports, a commotion erupts at the town's entrance. Rushing to see, you find a group of concerned citizens huddled around a figure being carried on a makeshift stretcher. It's a [[Wallabian]], her fur matted and her breathing labored. 'Bindi!' someone cries out. The town healer rushes forward, her face grave. 'Poisoned,' she mutters. The town's murmurs grow, with many now linking this incident to the mysterious rise of the Todek faction."*
