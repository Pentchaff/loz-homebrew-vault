### Homeland

[[Valleybrook]], with its endless fields of waving grasses, is the cherished homeland of the [[Wallabian]]s. This land, where the winds sing ancient lullabies and the soil tells tales of epochs gone by, is as much a part of the [[Wallabian]]s as they are of it. Amidst the verdant stretches, mysterious stone circles stand sentinel, guarding the secrets and sagas of the [[Wallabian]]s' storied past.

Their harmonious relations with the cheerful [[Quokkan]]s is well-known, while the stoic [[Thornar]]s remain a riddle they've yet to fully decipher. Legends of [[Valleybrook]] speak of [[Wallabian]] pathfinders who once charted the vast reaches of Oziria. Their woven masterpieces, spun from the threads of dreams and heritage, are sought after far and wide. Still, history recalls the Grassland Divide – a tumultuous period whose wounds have been healed by the [[Wallabian]]s' innate gift for understanding and reconciliation.
