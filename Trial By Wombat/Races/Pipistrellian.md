### About

In Shadowmireâ€™s dark corners, whispers of the Pipistrellian's nocturnal empire remain. Their elusive nature, once rulers of the night, now lingers as tales in old books and hidden alleys. A once mighty race, their influence is still felt in Oziria's darker arts.

Pipistrellians are enigmatic beings, drawing inspiration from the elusive pipistrelle bats. These humanoid creatures are slender and graceful, shrouded in an air of mystery. Their skin is a dusky shade, and their bodies are cloaked in fine, velvety fur that ranges from dark charcoals to midnight blues. Large, membranous wings extend from their backs, and their keen eyes, often a luminescent shade of yellow or silver, are adept at seeing in the dimmest of lights.

Masters of the night, Pipistrellians thrive in the moonlit hours, often emerging from the shadowy alcoves of their urban lairs in Shadowmire. Their nocturnal nature has made them adept at gathering secrets, making them exceptional spies and information brokers. Intrigue and subtlety are their tools, and many a deal or pact has been sealed under their watchful gaze. Although they tend to keep to their own, legends whisper of their once-dominant presence in Oziria's darker epochs and their complex relationships with other races, especially the Platypian and Koalarirellian.png]]
### Homeland

In the mysterious alleys of Shadowmire, echoes of the Pipistrellians' nocturnal pursuits still resonate. These elusive beings, once rulers of the night, had strained ties with the vigilant Platypians and the nature-guarding Koalari. The Moonlit Mazes, pathways of their once-grand empire, are now sought after by treasure hunters. However, whispers suggest that the Pipistrellians' influence still casts a shadow over Oziria's secrets.
