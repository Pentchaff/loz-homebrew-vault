### About

Emerging from Oziria's tranquil twilight is the Petaurii race, whose very essence seems to have been borrowed from the whimsical sugar gliders of a world long past. A soft fur, predominantly colored in hues of gray, brown, or cream, envelopes their bodies, occasionally revealing patterns that are reminiscent of their original inspirations. Itâ€™s their eyes, large and constantly radiating with inquisitiveness and a hint of playfulness, that truly captures one's attention.

The Petaurii's agility is legendary. With the night sky as their canvas, they paint stories of exploration, acrobatics, and boundless joy. Their affinity for heights and aerial stunts often leaves spectators in awe, as they effortlessly navigate the vast expanses of Oziria's skies. But it's not just agility that defines them; their adventurous spirit, woven with threads of joy and wonder, creates tales that echo through the ages.

### Homeland

[[Nightleaf]], the nocturnal jewel of Oziria, is where the Petaurii call home. Here, the boundaries between water and sky blur, as the celestial blanket above mirrors itself in pristine ponds and murmuring streams below. The landscape is dotted with vast meadows and enchanted clearings, all bathed in the ethereal glow of the moon and stars.

In [[Nightleaf]], the dance of the Petaurii, as they waltz with the winds and stars, becomes a nightly spectacle. Their camaraderie with the [[Wallabian]]s, built over shared tales and mutual admiration, adds another layer to the rich tapestry of [[Nightleaf]]'s history. Yet, the shadows of [[Canidor]]s occasionally threaten to disrupt this tranquility, their motives as shifting as desert sands.

The Starbranch Festival is not just an event; it's an embodiment of the Petaurii spirit. Illuminating [[Nightleaf]], it speaks of their connections, legacies, and the promise of brighter tomorrows. Moreover, their prowess doesn't end with aerial stunts; the Petaurii's silk star maps, intricate in design and rich in detail, are sought-after commodities, guiding travelers and traders through the mystique of Oziria.
