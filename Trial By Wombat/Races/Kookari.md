### About

From the vibrant avian tapestry of Oziria emerges the Kookari, reminiscent of the animated kookaburras of Earth's yore. Their sleek feathers, a canvas of brown, gray, blue, and more, glint in Oziria's sunlight, bearing distinct patterns that hint at their rich heritage. But it's their eyes, sharp and constantly gleaming with intelligence and a dash of mischief, that truly define them.

Beyond their striking appearance, the Kookari are spirits of jubilation personified. Their quick-wittedness isn't just for survival; it's a tool of entertainment, ensuring there's never a dull moment around them. With humor as their universal language, they've charmed many across Oziria. Perched high or exploring the grounds, their observations often become tales of mirth, resonating with laughter.

### Homeland

In the east of Oziria, where the land greets the ocean with an embrace, lies the Laughing Peak. The name isn't mere decoration; it's a testament to its inhabitants, the Kookari. Majestic hills roll with the rhythm of the sea breeze, expansive skies play host to artistic cloud patterns, and hidden caves hold secrets that whisper tales of old.

The very air in Laughing Peak is charged with energy, with melodious laughter acting as its continuous soundtrack. This isn't just the Kookari's homeland; it's their stage, where their tales of merriment, songs of the ocean, and art come alive. It's no wonder that the Echoing Festival, an event blending harmonies with history, is a spectacle that many across Oziria eagerly await.

While their bond with Petaurii and Quokkans is built on mutual mirth and admiration, the shadows of conflicts with the more territorial Crocosians occasionally darken their shores. However, even in contention, the Kookari's spirit remains undeterred. Their artistry, capturing the soul of the ocean and its myriad tales, is a coveted treasure in Oziria, ensuring that the laughter from the Laughing Peak continues to echo far and wide.
