From every nook and cranny of Oziria, the boisterous Todeks make their clamorous presence known. These creatures, with their lively demeanor and often misguided plans, are an omnipresent, entertaining sight. Their resounding croaks and slapstick actions serve as a comic backdrop to the otherwise serious dealings of Oziria.

Distinct in appearance and unmistakable in their sense of style, Todeks are easily identified by their self-curated ensembles. Mismatched attire, radiant trinkets, and often-borrowed accessories (to the chagrin of their original owners) make them stand out in any crowd. Far from intimidating, their primary trait is their mischievous nature. Yet, amidst this seemingly chaotic behavior, Todeks possess their own brand of social order, built around trinket prestige and vocal prowess.

Their bizarre affinities, like an inexplicable fondness for spoons and a talent for occupying abandoned spaces with unparalleled speed, make them a continuous source of amusement and exasperation. But let not their jesting disposition fool you; they are opportunists at heart. Leave your belongings unattended, and you might just find that your treasured possessions have become a Todek's latest fashion statement.
