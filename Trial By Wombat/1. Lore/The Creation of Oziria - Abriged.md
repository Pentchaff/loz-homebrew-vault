In the time before time, the world was a vast expanse of emptiness, a void without form or purpose. Yet from this void, the primal energies converged, and from their union, the first beings of power emerged. These were the Totemic Spirits, each embodying an aspect of the world yet to be. In their divine forms, they resembled the creatures that would soon populate the lands.

As the world began to take form, the Totemic Spirits, in their divine wisdom, realized that the world needed guardians, stewards to care for its bounty. From their essence, they birthed the first races, each race imbued with characteristics reminiscent of their Totemic patron. Thus, the races known today were graciously willed into existence.

However, the Totemic Spirits knew that balance was essential. Their creation wasn't just about the harmony of land, water, and sky, but also of life, death, growth, and decay. They entrusted their creations with the responsibility of maintaining this balance, giving them the free will to shape their destinies.

Oziria thrived under the guidance of these primal forces. Sacred sites were established, where the energies of these Totemic Spirits were particularly potent, and rituals were developed to honor and appease these gods. The stories of their creation and the lessons of the Totems were passed down through generations, becoming the foundation of Ozirian culture and civilization.

While the Totemic Spirits don't intervene directly in the affairs of Oziria anymore, their presence is always felt. In the rustling of the leaves, the gush of the rivers, the gust of the winds, and in the very heartbeats of every creature, the echoes of the Totems continue to resonate, reminding Ozirians of their roots and their boundless connection to the world around them.
