Sunbridge, with its sprawling harbors and emblematic bridges, stands as the trade powerhouse of Oziria. The skyline, punctuated by meticulously crafted towers, is mirrored by the pristine waters below, where merchant ships weave in and out, trading exotic goods and tales from far-off lands. While the [[Quokkan]] bring their jovial diplomacy, the [[Wallabian]] family guilds, [[Petaurii]] aerial acrobats, and [[Kookari]] artisans add layers of cultural richness. Music and laughter pervade the streets, and onlookers might catch a glimpse of a [[Kookari]]'s vibrant art piece or a [[Petaurii]]'s breathtaking mid-air dance. However, tension simmers below the surface. [[Crocosian]] warboats often prowl the harbor's outskirts, their eyes set on the city's treasures and strategic location, casting a wary shadow on the vibrant enclave.
