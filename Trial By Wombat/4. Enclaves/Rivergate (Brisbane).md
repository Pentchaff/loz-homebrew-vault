Nestled at the heart of converging rivers, Rivergate is an oasis of serenity. Waterways crisscross the enclave, with serene canals and bubbling streams, where the [[Platypian]] and [[Koalari]] live in harmony. The [[Platypian]]s, with their observant nature, maintain the waterways, while the [[Koalari]], in their druidic tradition, ensure that the surrounding greenery flourishes. Yet, beneath the city's calm facade lies a labyrinth of ancient tunnels and catacombs, previously the dominion of the long forgotten [[Pipistrellian]]. Banished from the streets above, they used to plot and scheme, their intentions cloaked in the very shadows they adore.
