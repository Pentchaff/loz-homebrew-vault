### Description

Murrundi is the keeper of Oziria's waters, from the smallest babbling brook to the grandest, enigmatic lake. It manifests as a serpentine water creature, its scales reflecting the many hues found within the depths of Oziria's aquatic realms. Murrundi's graceful, coiling movements in the cosmic void gave birth to Oziria's rivers, lakes, and oceans, each a labyrinth of liquid, life, and hidden mysteries.

### Cultural Influence

Murrundi is revered as the guardian of secrets and the unknown. It holds particular significance to fishermen, sailors, and mystics who seek to unravel the enigmas of both the physical and metaphysical worlds. Before venturing out on a fishing expedition or a sea voyage, it's common practice to offer small tokens or incantations to Murrundi for safe passage and bountiful catches.

Sacred pools dedicated to this Totemic Spirit are scattered throughout Oziria. These are places of meditation, divination, and occasionally, ritualistic cleansing. It's believed that dipping a treasured object into one of these pools can imbue it with a special blessing or protection from Murrundi.

The annual Festival of Flowing Wisdom is held near large bodies of water, where Ozirians gather to share secrets, riddles, and prophecies. Small boats carrying candles are released onto the water, each flame symbolizing a prayer or a question seeking Murrundi's divine insight.
