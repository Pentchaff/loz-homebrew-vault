>[!recite|bg-gray] #### DM Narration for Assisting Dr. Webbly:
>You stand at the edge of the town's water supply, a pool once vibrant but now sullied by toxins. Dr. Webbly, adorned in his eclectic mix of scientist's attire and makeshift armor, holds up a beaker containing the newly synthesized anti-toxin.
>
>"Brave souls, if you hadn't dealt with Syl, all my work would have been for naught. Here goes nothingâ€”or rather, here goes everything!"
>
>With a deep breath, he pours the anti-toxin into the water. Almost immediately, the ripples carry a radiant shimmer, and you sense an underlying magical aura, perhaps a gift from the land itself for vanquishing its tormentor.
>
>The water sparkles and clarifies, each ripple echoing your hard-won victory. Dr. Webbly's beaker is empty, but his eyes are full of hope.
>
>"By the celestial stars! It worked! You've not just saved this town; you've saved countless lives. Mirebrook will be a sanctuary once more, and its waters will sing songs of your heroism!"

>[!recite|bg-gray] #### DM Narration for Assisting Elder Billee
>
>The air is thick with spiritual energy as you gather at the shores of Mirebrook's ailing waters. Elder Billee stands ready, her face drawn but determined. She holds up an intricate talisman, imbued with the essence of the herb you recovered.
>
>"You've vanquished the Poison Mistress, the shadow upon our land. Now, let the light shine through."
>
>She chants incantations, her voice harmonizing with the wind, her words a balm to the wounded earth. As she releases the talisman into the water, an ethereal light emanates from it, cascading in waves that purify everything they touch.
>
>The water glows, and you feel a sense of renewal, as if the very land itself is inhaling deeply for the first time in an age.
>
>Elder Billee smiles, wearied but fulfilled.
>
>"It is complete. Your deeds shall live on in the annals of Ozirian folklore. The spirits have found their champions, and Mirebrook shall flourish once again."
