#### Dr. Webbly’s Path

>[!recite|bg-gray] **DM** 
>Dr. Webbly tells you he needs special apparatus to complete his purifying potion. The apparatus is kept in the town storage cabin, but is guarded by Lieutenant Dral and her goons.

#### Objective
The Party need to stealth their way around Lieutenant Dral (or take her on in combat) in order to unlock the storage cabin.

##### Approaching Lieutenant Dral
>[!recite|bg-gray] DM
>As you navigate the twisted lanes of the afflicted village, a sudden rustling echoes through the foggy air. Emerging from the thick mist, a cadre of Todek warriors takes formation around a central figure—a Todek of impressive poise and chilling confidence. This is Lieutenant Dral, her scales a darker hue than her subordinates', her eyes emanating a malicious glint that chills you to the core.
>
>She sweeps a calculating gaze over her goon squad, each Todek bristling with cruelly fashioned weapons, and wearing a grin that is more a snarl. Dral’s own weapon, a serrated scimitar, glows with a faint, otherworldly energy. She looks your party over and scoffs.

>>"So, the [[Platypian]]s have sent their champions? How droll. Do you honestly think you can stop us? Mirebrook's fate is sealed, just like the storage cabin behind me. What you seek is beyond your reach."
>
>As she speaks, her goons shuffle restlessly, their eyes locked onto you, their fingers itching for the signal to attack.
>
>Lieutenant Dral shifts her weight, placing a hand on the hilt of her scimitar. Her gaze narrows.

>>[!quote|] Lt. Dral
>>"Enough talk. You're trespassing on Todek grounds, and the penalty is severe. Surrender, flee, or face your doom. Choose quickly; my patience is shorter than a gnome's lifespan."

#### Returning the Herbs
>[!recite|bg-gray] DM
>"You stand at the edge of the town's water supply, a pool once vibrant but now sullied by toxins. Dr. Webbly, adorned in his eclectic mix of scientist's attire and makeshift armor, holds up a beaker containing the newly synthesized anti-toxin."

>> *"Brave souls, if you haven't dealt with Syl, all my work will be for naught. Have you taken care of the poison mistress? Once she's dealt with we can test this concoction on the water supply"*
