> Cautiously, you and your companions stay ensconced behind the frayed canvas of a Todek supply tent. [[Vorkesh]], his eyes alight with malevolence, ascends a makeshift platform, flanked by his most trusted commanders. You strain your ears to catch every word, blending in with the encompassing dark.
> 
> Clearing his throat, [[Vorkesh]] intones, "Fellow Todek, tonight is not just another night; it marks the eve of our triumph! We have laced the water supply of Mirebrook with a toxin so potent, not even the [[Platypian]]s' fabled resistance can counteract its lethal effects."
> 
> His words are met with an uproar of croaks and growls from the assembled Todek, a cacophony that could deafen even a dragon. [[Vorkesh]] smirks, savoring their approval, "Prepare yourselves, for we shall soon turn our sights to the Capital of the Whispering Marshes. Their annihilation is nigh, and the dawn of the Todek reign is at hand!"
> 
> As [[Vorkesh]] leaves the platform and the warriors disperse to their tasks, you carefully extricate yourselves from your hiding spots. Your hearts pound with a mixture of dread and urgency. Mirebrook's peril is confirmed, and a toxin potent enough to affect even [[Platypian]]s spells certain catastrophe.
> 
> As you slink back into the veil of the marsh, a singular, inescapable thought eclipses all others: you must rush to the Capital of the Whispering Marshes. The [[Platypian]]s need to be warned, countermeasures must be planned, and time is running perilously short.
