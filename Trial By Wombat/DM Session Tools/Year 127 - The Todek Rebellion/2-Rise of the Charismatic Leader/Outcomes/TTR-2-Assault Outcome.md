The party has made an unwise decision but who was to know he was that powerful? Oh well, you live (hopefully) and learn.


>[!column|c-red] Who did the party attack?
>> [!recite|bg-gray] ***Any Todek follower or Scouter:***
>> *"The crowd falls silent for only a moment before the entire encampment realeases an excruciating unison of croaks. Todek within the camp jump up and down, reluctant to retaliate, but looking toward their fierce leader to do something about the violent intruders who have not only heard their plans. A split second goes by before the party is expelled by an invisible force. Laying on the ground, and with blurry vision, you see the Todek leader float towards you."*

>>[!recite|bg-gray] ***[[Vorkesh]] or Relgar***
>>*"You are filled with hope that things will end swiftly as the Todek leaders fall. As your attack approaches, however, a sudden burst of energy repulses everything nearby. A splatter of runic symbols at the point of impact, which seems like nothing but thin air, sends the party flying backwards"*


>[!recite|c-black] ##### [[Vorkesh]] approaches 
>[[Vorkesh]] approaches the players. He floats over the ground, hovering menacingly above the party.

>>[!recite|bg-red] [[Vorkesh]] 
>>"You really think it was that simple hmm? Not to worry. Let this serve as a warning to the rest of your kind. Leave now for the capital and tell the others of your failure.. There's already blood in the water, or should I say.. poison?"*

>>[!recite|bg-gray] Narrator
>>*"While your physical senses gather themselves, your common sense tells you that there's more going on than meets the eye. [[Vorkesh]] has had mercy on you today, but you mightn't be so lucky next time. Alluding to poison in the water, you gather a growing fear that there's something sinister occurring elsewhere that the officials of the [[About the Whispering Marshes]]should see to."*


#### Where to now?

It's advised that the party head back to the capital of the [[About the Whispering Marshes]]and alert the officials that there are plans to poison nearby water supplies. If they managed to gather any intel about the location of the plans they can also head straight there.
