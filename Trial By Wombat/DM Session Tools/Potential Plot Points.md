    - **Year 0: The Calming**
    **Description:**  
    
    After the immense upheaval brought about by the "Cataclysm of Thylacirians and [[Pipistrellian]]s, and the [[Diprotean]] Sacrifice," the very essence of Oziria seemed shattered. Lands lay barren, skies were tinted with remnants of arcane energies, and a profound silence enveloped the realm. The races that survived found themselves amidst ruins, both of their homes and of the intricate web of relationships that once tied them together.
    
    The very balance of Oziria had been disrupted, and while the immediate threat of annihilation had been averted, the path ahead was unclear. The void left by the vanished races was palpable, their tales and memories a reminder of the cost of unchecked conflict.
    
    As days turned to weeks, leaders of each race began gathering their kin, accounting for their numbers, and assessing the damages. Food was scarce, and many areas were tainted with residual magics from the great cataclysm, making them uninhabitable.
    
    Recognizing the fragility of their situation, the heads of each race convened in what would be historically known as "The Council of New Dawn." Held amidst the ruins of what once was a great city at the heart of Oziria, this gathering sought to chart the path ahead.
    
    Months of deliberations followed. The histories of the Thylacirian and [[Pipistrellian]] were meticulously studied, their mistakes analyzed. A new constitution was drafted, aiming not just to rebuild Oziria, but to ensure such a cataclysmic event would never recur.
    
    The **Ozirian Pact** was formed, a set of rules and guidelines binding every race. It decreed:
	1. No single race shall claim dominion over another.
	2. Territories and resources would be shared, with a central council mediating any disputes.
	3. Annual gatherings, known as **The Harmony Festivals**, would be held to foster understanding and camaraderie among races.
	4. Sacred sites, where residual energies of the cataclysm were strongest, would be preserved as memorials and warnings.
	5. An academy would be established, dedicated to understanding the arcane, ensuring magic's responsible use, and studying the events leading to the cataclysm to prevent history from repeating itself.
	
	**The Calming** was not just a period of physical reconstruction but of societal reformation. Trust was slow to rebuild, but the shared trauma of the cataclysm became a foundation upon which new alliances were forged. The races of Oziria, once scattered and diverse, now shared a collective history and a united vision for a harmonious future.

11. **Year 489: The Rift Resurgence**
    
    **Description:**  
    
    The world of Oziria is no stranger to tales of old, whispers of once mighty races that walked its lands and soared its skies. As eons passed, the stories of the Thylacirian, [[Pipistrellian]], and the noble [[Diprotean]] who once intervened to save the realm faded into myth. But myths have roots in reality, and as the calendar pages turned to the year 489, unsettling phenomena began.
    
    The landscapes bore the first signs. Ancient trees in the [[Tranquil Canopy]] suddenly withered. Murmurs in the [[About the Whispering Marshes]]turned to eerie screams. Astral phenomena, previously unseen, painted the skies. But most alarming were the visions: ethereal echoes of Thylacirian and [[Pipistrellian]] warriors battling across the skies and grounds, ghostly but becoming more tangible with each passing day.
    
    The ancient scrolls of the [[Wombari]] and the tales of the oldest [[Koalari]] spoke of a ritual, one that had banished these races to prevent their destructive war from consuming Oziria. The [[Diprotean]], custodians of this ritual, were said to uphold it for eternity. But eternity is a long time, and it seemed they were weakening.
    
    As the celestial signs intensified, it became evident: the barrier between realms was thinning. If not fortified, the Thylacirian and [[Pipistrellian]] would return, reigniting their cataclysmic feud, and Oziria would be the battleground.
    
    **Hooks for the Party:**
    1. **The Astral Anomaly:** Observatories across Oziria detect unusual celestial patterns. The party is hired to investigate one such event, leading them to an ancient ruin with depictions of the three extinct races.
    2. **Dreams of War:** The party's spellcaster (or a key NPC they know) experiences a vivid dream of the great battle between the Thylacirian and [[Pipistrellian]], feeling an urge to head towards a forgotten shrine deep in the [[Waterscale]] territory.
    3. **The Weakening Guardians:** [[Diprotean]] spirits, once unseen, begin to appear, distressed and seeking aid. They communicate about their failing strength and the imminent return of the banished races.
    4. **Relics Resurfacing:** Artifacts belonging to the Thylacirian and [[Pipistrellian]] races, thought lost, start appearing in markets. These relics possess residual energies and could be key to understanding and potentially halting the impending catastrophe.
    5. **The Crying Land:** Natural disasters start occurring at an alarming rate, from the deepest cave to the highest peak. As the party investigates, they discover that these are not mere natural events but signs of the weakening ritual and the looming return of the vanished races.
    6. **Councils of Oziria:** Recognizing the imminent threat, councils and assemblies are held among various races of Oziria. The party, due to their reputation, might be summoned to represent or aid in these crucial discussions, strategizing the defense and potential salvation of Oziria.
