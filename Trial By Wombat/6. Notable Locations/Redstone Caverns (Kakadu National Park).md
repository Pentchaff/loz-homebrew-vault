#### Redstone Caverns (Kakadu National Park): Dungeon

The caverns, known for their deep red hues, were once the meeting ground for various tribes. Over time, as enemies threatened Oziria, the tribes used the caverns to hide precious artifacts. Now, the caverns are filled with traps, puzzles, and ancient mysteries.
