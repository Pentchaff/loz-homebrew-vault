#### Dragon's Breath Gorge (Katherine Gorge): Canyon

A beautiful canyon, carved over millennia by a river said to have been birthed from a dragon's tear. The [[Quokkan]] established peaceful settlements along its banks, but during the Great Rift, a battle saw the gorge become a natural barrier against the advancing [[Crocosian]] army.
