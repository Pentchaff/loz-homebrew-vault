# Sunlit Elixirs Apothecary

The fragrance of sunshine and magical herbs dances in the air as you walk into the Sunlit Elixirs Apothecary. Managed by Alchemirth, a radiant Kookari with an ever-present smile, this apothecary is an altar to Laughing Peak's natural bounty. The sunlit herbs are carefully infused into elixirs, teas, and balms that make adventurers glowâ€”both literally and metaphorically.
