# Fogweave Fashions

Located deep within the mystical realm of Dawthorn, Fogweave Fashions is a unique boutique run by Spirula the Echidnarian. This ethereal establishment specializes in garments crafted from the very essence of the forest mists. Decorated with veils of gossamer and hung with samples of its delicate wares, the interior gives the sensation of being both indoors and outdoors, as if the fog itself serves as walls and ceiling. The scent of morning dew and fresh ferns perfumes the air, blending seamlessly with the mysterious ambiance.
