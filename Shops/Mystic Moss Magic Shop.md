# Mystic Moss Magic Shop

Tucked away among ancient trees and mystical clearings, Mystic Moss Magic Shop is the heart of arcane study within Dawthorn. The shop is managed by Thistleclaw, an Echidnarian mage of considerable talent. The walls are lined with mossy shelves and mystical runes, lending a palpable aura of enchantment to the establishment. Bunches of dried herbs dangle from the ceiling, and glass jars filled with arcane ingredients glisten on the counters. A subtle aroma of earth and incense pervades the air, while the ambient light seems to emanate from glowing moss patches on the walls.
