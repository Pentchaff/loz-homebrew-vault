# Giggling Groceries General Store

Perched on a hill overlooking the valley, the Giggling Groceries General Store is the epitome of Kookari cheerfulness. You'll hear the laughter before you see the store. Managed by a jovial Kookari named Chucklesong, the store is filled with brightly-colored goods, and a subtle scent of berries and spices fills the air. Everything about this shop encourages a lighthearted, cheerful shopping experience, almost as if the walls themselves are smiling.
