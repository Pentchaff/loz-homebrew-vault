### About

Across the rolling expanses of Valleybrook’s verdant hills, the Wallabian bound energetically. Their powerful legs carry them on journeys of discovery, while their inquisitive gaze always seems to be searching for new horizons. At their core, they are beings deeply rooted in the bonds of family and kinship. From intrepid explorers to skilled grass-weavers, the Wallabian have carved out a niche for themselves in Oziria.

With coats resembling the hues of the earth, from sandy browns to deep reddish tones, the Wallabian seamlessly blend with their natural surroundings.

### Homeland

Valleybrook, with its endless fields of waving grasses, is the cherished homeland of the Wallabian. This land, where the winds sing ancient lullabies and the soil tells tales of epochs gone by, is as much a part of the Wallabian as they are of it. Amidst the verdant stretches, mysterious stone circles stand sentinel, guarding the secrets and sagas of the Wallabian' storied past.

Their harmonious relations with the cheerful Quokkans is well-known, while the stoic Thornars remain a riddle they've yet to fully decipher. Legends of Valleybrook speak of Wallabian pathfinders who once charted the vast reaches of Oziria. Their woven masterpieces, spun from the threads of dreams and heritage, are sought after far and wide. Still, history recalls the Grassland Divide – a tumultuous period whose wounds have been healed by the Wallabian' innate gift for understanding and reconciliation.
