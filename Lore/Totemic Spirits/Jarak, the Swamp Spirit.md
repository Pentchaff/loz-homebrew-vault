### Description

Jarak is the primal force of power, ferocity, and the relentless march of time. Manifesting as a fearsome beast, part crocodile and part boar, Jarak's roar shattered the timeless void and set the cosmic clock ticking. With its incomparable energy, it shaped Oziria's marshlands, lagoons, and swamps—each a labyrinthine realm teeming with both danger and life.

### Cultural Influence

Jarak is revered as a deity of both creation and destruction, embodying the cyclical nature of life and death in Oziria. Soldiers and warriors often seek the Swamp Spirit's blessing before going into battle, honoring its ferocity and power. Temples dedicated to Jarak usually sit on the edge of swamps or marshlands, often appearing as if they are being reclaimed by the land—a constant reminder of the passage of time.

The Festival of Roaring Time is an annual tradition that marks the new year in the Ozirian calendar. People gather around large bonfires to offer sacrifices and prayers to Jarak, imploring the spirit to grant them the strength to face the challenges of the coming year. Participants engage in ritualistic roaring contests, mimicking the sound that first set time into motion, and thereby acknowledging Jarak's primordial role.

Elders in Ozirian society hold Jarak in high regard, often interpreting the Spirit's teachings as lessons in embracing the duality of existence—strength and vulnerability, life and decay, timelessness and impermanence.
