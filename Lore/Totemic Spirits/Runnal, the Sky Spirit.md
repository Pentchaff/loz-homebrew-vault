### Description

Runnal is the celestial breath that fills Oziria's skies. Manifesting as a swift, ethereal bird-like creature with feathers made of cloud and a trail of wind behind it, this Totemic Spirit embodies speed, air, and endless horizons. As Runnal races across the cosmic void, it creates the myriad skies above Oziriaâ€”setting clouds adrift, summoning winds, and shaping the heavens themselves.

### Cultural Influence

Runnal holds a special place in the hearts of Ozirians who long for adventure, freedom, and the thrill of the unknown. Navigators, sailors, and explorers pay homage to this Spirit before embarking on a journey, hoping for favorable winds and clear skies.

In many Ozirian cities, tall towers and platforms are built as places of worship to be closer to Runnal's domain. Here, ritualistic wind dances are performed, and kites adorned with sacred symbols are flown to send prayers to the Sky Spirit.

Runnal's influence also touches the realm of music and art. Flutes and wind instruments are considered sacred, and many songs are composed to mimic the sound of the howling wind or the soft rustle of a gentle breeze. During the annual Skydance Festival, people gather to watch the coordinated flight of trained birds, symbolizing Runnal's swift and unbounded nature.
