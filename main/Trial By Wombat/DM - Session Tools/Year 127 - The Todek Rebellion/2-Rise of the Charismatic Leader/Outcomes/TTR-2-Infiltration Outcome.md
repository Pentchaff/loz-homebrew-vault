As you and your party cautiously approach the Todek encampment, you spot the War Tent ahead, its larger size and more ornate decorations marking it as the epicenter of Todek planning. Armed guards patrol the perimeter, their nostrils flaring, as if sniffing out the very air for intruders.

You exchange glances with your party. The plans you seek lie within that tent, and you know that getting to them will require every ounce of your stealth, cunning, and skill.

**DM**: As you get closer to the War Tent, you sense an aura of arcane energy emanating from the entrance. This tent isn’t just well-guarded; it’s magically warded.
