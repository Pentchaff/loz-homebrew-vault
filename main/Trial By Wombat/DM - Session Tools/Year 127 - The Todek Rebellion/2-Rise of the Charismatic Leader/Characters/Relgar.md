## Character Backstory; Allies And Organizations

| Name Of Ally/Organization | Story Organizations; Story Details   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Plop                     | Childhood friend; fellow misfit     |

Relgar grew up in a secluded marsh in Oziria, full of riddles and radiant trinkets. It wasn't long before he found himself tangled in the matters of the Todek community, often as the instigator of some grand mischief. Despite this mischievous nature, he proved his mettle during a battle against swamp raiders, earning him the begrudging respect of his tribe. Hungry for more than just trinkets and tired of the confines of his marshy home, Relgar set out to the greater world, greatsword in hand and dreams of glory lighting up his eyes like the most mesmerizing of gemstones. As he journeys, the whispers of a greater destiny pull at him, as do the shiny objects he comes across. But Relgar isn't concerned with destiny; he's more interested in the next piece of treasure he can find, or the next laugh he can share with the friends he makes along the way.
