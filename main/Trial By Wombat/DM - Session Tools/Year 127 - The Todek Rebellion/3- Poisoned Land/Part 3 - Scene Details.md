>_As you approach the town, you notice an eerie silence; there's no usual chatter of townsfolk or laughter of children playing in the streets. The banners of the town have been replaced with those of the Todek faction, a symbol you've come to recognize. Drawing nearer to the central well, you see empty buckets strewn haphazardly, and a few townsfolk lying motionless near its edge. A bitter, unfamiliar scent hangs in the air. A local, their face pale and voice trembling, approaches you, "Don't drink the water... it's cursed. People... they just froze where they stood. Please seek Dr. Webbly, or Elder Billee... The must be able to do something to fix this"_

#### Things to do
There's a variety of things that the party could do from within the town.

To its left, directly across the river, puffs of colourful smoke periodically pop out of a chimney."*
