#### Traits

**Shadow Cloak.** While in dim light or darkness, the Todek Shadowspeaker can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

**Echolocation.** The Todek Shadowspeaker can't use its blindsight while deafened.

#### Actions

**Multiattack.** The Todek Shadowspeaker makes two attacks with its Shadowy Whispers.

**Shadowy Whispers.** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 30 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 9 (2d4 + 4) psychic damage and the target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of their next turn.

**Sonic Scream (Recharge 5-6).** The Todek Shadowspeaker emits a dreadful scream in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save are also deafened for 1 minute.

#### Reactions

**Sound Amplification.** When a creature the Todek Shadowspeaker can see makes a noise, such as casting a verbal spell or shouting, it can use its reaction to amplify the sound. The noise is heard in a 300-foot radius, potentially alerting others.
